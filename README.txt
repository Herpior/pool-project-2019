A school project comparing image recognition performance with different pooling functions in cifar-10 dataset.

requires pytorch.

three models were used, lenet-5 with 6 and 16 channels in conv layers, lenet-5 with 16 and 32 channels in the conv layers and resnet.
LPPool2d, MaxPool2d, AvgPool2d, 50-50 mixed max avg pool, mixed max avg pool and min pool 

A lot of the code is reused from the assignments.
